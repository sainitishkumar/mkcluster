Steps to use:

1. Unzip the folder into a location.
2. Load the extension into chrome.
3. Open any Stackoverflow post, we show:
	-> The original/ duplicate tag.
	-> The Question in the page.
	-> An option for users to mark the post.
	-> Review from the user side for the analyis.
	-> A graph which can be modified to show the number of original/ duplicate posts in the respective tags of the post.
